## What is wowswap ?

Wowswap is an open source exchange platform that currently supports 2 cryptocurrencies internally wownero and nano. <br/>
And 400+ crypto thanks to our partner nanswap. <br/>
The fees for the wownero/nano pair are currently 5% and will probably drop in the future <br/>

## Functioning

### Deposits and withdrawals of cryptocurrencies

For depositing and withdrawing cryptocurrencies, wowswap uses another personal project, nanpay

### Price calculation

To calculate the price of wowero, wowswap uses the nonkyc orderbook to retrieve the purchase or sale amount. <br/>
For example, if a user swaps 100 XNO to WOW. <br/>
It multiplies 100 XNO by the price of the XNO, then it looks on nonkyc how many WOW it can buy with the total amount.
